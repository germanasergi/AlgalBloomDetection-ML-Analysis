# AlgalBloomDetection-ML-Analysis

This repository presents a comparative analysis of machine learning methods for detecting harmful algal blooms (HABs) using remote sensing images. 
Leveraging datasets from NOAA and Sentinel satellites, the project evaluates algorithms such as KNN, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine to improve the monitoring of HABs in Florida's coastal waters.

## Project overview 
Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become increasingly prevalent in coastal and freshwater systems, leading to significant ecological and economic impacts. These blooms, often caused by the over-enrichment of nutrients in water, can result in water discoloration and detrimental effects on marine life, including fish and mammal populations. In Florida, the primary strain of concern is Karenia brevis, which poses risks to human health through toxin emissions that can lead to skin irritations and respiratory issues. 
The provided code implements various machine learning techniques for classifying algal blooms based on Chlorophyll-a concentration measurements, facilitating enhanced detection and management strategies.
